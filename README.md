# Research Assistant with EXA AI and Klavis AI

A comprehensive Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that integrates Exa AI's semantic search capabilities for building intelligent research assistants and AI-powered applications.

## üéØ Project Overview

This repository contains a complete MCP server implementation that transforms Exa AI's neural search technology into atomic, AI-friendly tools. Originally developed for the Klavis AI ecosystem, this server enables Large Language Models to perform intelligent web research, content analysis, and similarity discovery.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

- **5 Atomic MCP Tools** for different search scenarios
- **Semantic Web Search** using natural language understanding
- **Content Extraction** from any web page
- **Similarity Discovery** based on URLs or text samples
- **Recent Content Search** with time filtering
- **Example-Based Search** for finding related content
